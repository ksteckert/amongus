      Click <a href="server.zip">here</a> to download the <b>Among Us in Minecraft</b> server config for PaperMC.
      <br>
      After you unzip the file to a directory, use the <i>paper_download</i> link to download PaperMC into the directory.  If you download a newer version of PaperMC manually, be sure to update <i>paper_among_us.bat</i> with the correct version of <i>paper_XXX.jar</i>.
